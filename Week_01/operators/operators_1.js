/* 
1. Create two variables, a and b, and assign them integer values (e.g., 8 and 3).
2. Perform the following operations using a and b, and store the results in separate variables:
 - Add the values (sum).
 - Subtract b from a (difference).
 - Multiply the values (product).
 - Divide a by b (quotient).
 - Find the remainder when a is divided by b (remainder).
3. Use console.log() to print the results of each operation. For example, print: "The sum of a and b is: 11"
4. Add comments to explain what each operation does.
5. Change the values of a and b and observe how the results change.
6. Try the same operations with one positive and one negative number.

let a = 6;
let b = 9;
// these are the variables//
let sum = a + b;

console.log("Sum of a and b is:", sum);
//this prints the sum of variables a and b//

let Subtract = a - b;
console.log("Subtract of a and b is:", Subtract);
//this prints the subtract of variables a and b//

let Multiply = a * b;
console.log("Multiply of a and b is:", Multiply);
//this prints the multiply of variables a and b//

let Divide = a / b;
console.log("Divide of a and b is:", Divide);
//this prints the divide of variables a and b//

let remainder = a % b;
console.log("Remainder of a and b is", remainder);
//this prints the remainder of variables a and b//
